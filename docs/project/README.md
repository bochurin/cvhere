# Project Documentation

Strategic project documentation defining what we're building and how we work.

## Files

- **[CONCEPT.md](CONCEPT.md)** - Platform vision, features, and core concepts
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - High-level tech stack and infrastructure overview
- **[MVP-SCOPE.md](MVP-SCOPE.md)** - MVP features, limitations, and success metrics
- **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** - Security measures, privacy, and compliance
- **[WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md)** - Git workflow, branching, and CI/CD process

## Purpose

This folder contains the foundational documents that define:
- **What** we're building (concept, MVP scope)
- **How** it's structured (architecture, security)
- **How** we work together (workflow)

These documents are strategic and change infrequently. They provide context for all development work.

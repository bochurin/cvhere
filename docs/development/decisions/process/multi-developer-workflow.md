# Multi-Developer Workflow Decision

## 2024-12-19 - Documentation Merge Target Correction

**Context**: Correcting documentation workflow for multi-developer team coordination
**Problem**: Original docs-commit.sh merged directly to main, bypassing develop branch and breaking team workflow

**Issue Identified**:
- Documentation bypassed develop branch (feature → main)
- Code followed proper workflow (feature → develop → main)
- Inconsistent workflows caused coordination problems
- Main branch could get ahead of develop branch

**Decision**: Documentation follows same workflow as code
**Target**: **feature → develop → main**

**Implementation**:
- **docs-commit.sh** merges to develop instead of main
- **Team coordination** through develop branch
- **Integration testing** for documentation in develop
- **Consistent workflow** for all changes

**Benefits**:
- **Proper team workflow** - all changes flow through develop
- **Integration testing** - documentation tested before main
- **Branch consistency** - main never ahead of develop
- **Team coordination** - developers sync through develop

**Team Workflow**:
```bash
# Developer workflow
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop              # Get latest changes
git checkout -b feature/new-feature  # Create feature branch
# ... work on feature and docs ...
npm run docs:commit                  # Commits docs, merges to develop
git push origin feature/new-feature  # Push feature work

# Integration
# Create PR: feature/new-feature → develop
# After merge: develop → main (regular team process)
```

**Scripts Updated**:
- **docs-commit.sh** - Now merges to develop
- **feature-docs-commit.sh** - Already correct (develop workflow)

**Documentation Updated**:
- **workflow.md** - Reflects develop merge target
- **README.md** - Updated documentation strategy
- **documentation-strategy.md** - Corrected workflow description

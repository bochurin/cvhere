# Package Management Decision

## 2024-12-19 - Package Manager and Structure

**Context**: Choose package manager and structure for CVHere monorepo
**Options**: 
- Individual package.json per component vs single root package.json
- npm vs yarn vs pnpm

**Decisions**:
1. **npm workspaces**: Proper monorepo structure with separate package.json per workspace
2. **npm**: Standard package manager, no extra setup needed
3. **Vite**: Modern bundler for faster development and builds

**Reasons**:
- **Proper separation**: Each workspace manages its own dependencies
- **CI/CD friendly**: Workspaces work well with GitHub Actions
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new workspaces (shared, database, etc.)
- **Standard approach**: Industry best practice for monorepos

**Implementation**:
- Root package.json with workspaces configuration
- Backend and frontend as separate workspaces
- Workspace-scoped scripts (npm run build --workspace=backend)
- Concurrently for running multiple services
- Shared dependencies managed at root level when needed

**Future considerations**:
- Can migrate to npm workspaces when team grows
- Can switch to yarn/pnpm if performance becomes issue

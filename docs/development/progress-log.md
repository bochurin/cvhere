# CVHere - Development Log

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Privacy-first CV platform with atomic data model
**Approach**: Cross-feature development - switch between features as dependencies emerge
**Current Phase**: Phase 3 Complete - Ready for Authentication System

## Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Project Foundation (Completed)
- ✅ Git Repository with comprehensive structure
- ✅ Documentation organized with decision tracking
- ✅ Architecture decisions (Node.js + React + PostgreSQL + Terraform)
- ✅ Repository structure (monorepo with backend/frontend/shared folders)
- ✅ Development workflow defined (feature branches with CI/CD)

### ✅ Phase 2: Basic App Foundation (Completed)
- ✅ Minimal Fastify backend with TypeScript and health endpoint
- ✅ React frontend with Vite and health check component
- ✅ Pipeline-driven YAML configuration system
- ✅ CORS integration for frontend-backend communication
- ✅ Environment display in browser tab with connection detection
- ✅ Reliable start/stop with proper Ctrl+C handling

### ✅ Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation (Completed)
**Branch**: `feature/ci-cd-pipeline`

**Completed:**
- ✅ **Terraform Infrastructure**: EC2 with S3 backend, proper state management
- ✅ **GitHub Actions Pipeline**: Automated build, deploy, and service management
- ✅ **AWS Integration**: Credentials, security groups, SSH access configured
- ✅ **Docker Deployment**: Container-based deployment replacing manual processes
- ✅ **Environment Configuration**: Dynamic config injection per environment
- ✅ **Resource Naming**: Proper naming without AWS prefixes/postfixes
- ✅ **Single Server Strategy**: Cost-effective deployment with Docker containers

### 🚧 Phase 4: Docker Enhancement (In Progress)
**Branch**: `feature/docker-deployment`

**Current Work:**
- 🕰️ **Docker Containers**: Backend and frontend Dockerfiles created
- 🕰️ **Docker Compose**: Service orchestration configuration
- 🕰️ **Infrastructure Update**: Terraform updated for Docker installation
- 🕰️ **CI/CD Integration**: Pipeline updated for container deployment

**Next Steps:**
- 🕰️ **Test Docker deployment** end-to-end
- 🕰️ **Add PostgreSQL container** for database
- 🕰️ **Implement blue-green deployment** with container swapping

### Phase 4: Authentication System (Planned)
- TODO: Simplified JWT-based authentication (no email verification initially)
- TODO: Basic user registration and login
- TODO: Protected routes and middleware
- TODO: Password hashing with bcrypt

### Phase 5: Core Features (Planned)
- TODO: Database schema design (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
- TODO: Basic profile builder with atomic data model
- TODO: Simple keyword-based matching algorithm
- TODO: PDF export functionality
- TODO: Contact request system

## Current Status

**Active Branch**: `feature/ci-cd-pipeline` (ready to merge)
**Focus**: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation - COMPLETED
**Latest Changes**: 
- ✅ **Working CI/CD Pipeline**: Terraform + GitHub Actions + SSH deployment
- ✅ **Automated Server Setup**: Node.js installation via NVM in user_data
- ✅ **Manual Testing**: Verified server creation and Node.js installation
- ✅ **Documentation Updates**: Updated feature logs to reflect actual implementation
**Ready For**: Authentication system development with full CI/CD support

## Development Approach

**Cross-Feature Development**: Features are developed incrementally, switching between them as dependencies and learnings emerge. For example:
- Start **basic-app** foundation
- Switch to **ci-cd-pipeline** for deployment infrastructure
- Return to **basic-auth** with proper CI/CD support
- Enhance **ci-cd-pipeline** based on auth requirements

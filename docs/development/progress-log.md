# CVHere - Development Log

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Privacy-first CV platform with atomic data model
**Approach**: Cross-feature development - switch between features as dependencies emerge
**Current Phase**: Phase 3 - CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Project Foundation (Completed)
- ✅ Git Repository with comprehensive structure
- ✅ Documentation organized with decision tracking
- ✅ Architecture decisions (Node.js + React + PostgreSQL + Terraform)
- ✅ Repository structure (monorepo with backend/frontend/shared folders)
- ✅ Development workflow defined (feature branches with CI/CD)

### ✅ Phase 2: Basic App Foundation (Completed)
- ✅ Minimal Fastify backend with TypeScript and health endpoint
- ✅ React frontend with Vite and health check component
- ✅ Pipeline-driven YAML configuration system
- ✅ CORS integration for frontend-backend communication
- ✅ Environment display in browser tab with connection detection
- ✅ Reliable start/stop with proper Ctrl+C handling

### ✅ Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation (Completed)
**Branch**: `feature/ci-cd-pipeline`

**Completed:**
- ✅ Complete Terraform infrastructure (VPC, EC2, Security Groups, S3 backend, nginx)
- ✅ Full GitHub Actions workflows with actual deployment logic
- ✅ Environment separation with staging/production configurations
- ✅ Deployment scripts (deploy-backend.sh, deploy-frontend.sh, health-check.sh)
- ✅ Docker support with multi-stage builds and compose files
- ✅ Health check automation and monitoring setup
- ✅ Terraform backend setup (S3 + DynamoDB)
- ✅ Environment-specific configuration management
- ✅ Comprehensive deployment documentation
- ✅ Package.json scripts for all deployment scenarios

**Ready For:**
- TODO: Configure AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in GitHub secrets
- TODO: Run terraform apply and test deployment scripts
- TODO: Point staging.cvhere.net and cvhere.net to EC2 instances

### Phase 4: Authentication System (Planned)
- TODO: Simplified JWT-based authentication (no email verification initially)
- TODO: Basic user registration and login
- TODO: Protected routes and middleware
- TODO: Password hashing with bcrypt

### Phase 5: Core Features (Planned)
- TODO: Database schema design (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
- TODO: Basic profile builder with atomic data model
- TODO: Simple keyword-based matching algorithm
- TODO: PDF export functionality
- TODO: Contact request system

## Current Status

**Active Branch**: `feature/ci-cd-pipeline`
**Focus**: Documentation workflow automation - implementing selective commit/merge strategy
**Current Activity**: Developing `scripts/docs-workflow.sh` to automate documentation strategy (commit docs-only, exclude feature logs, selective merge to main)
**Ready For**: Authentication system development with full CI/CD support

## Development Approach

**Cross-Feature Development**: Features are developed incrementally, switching between them as dependencies and learnings emerge. For example:
- Start **basic-app** foundation
- Switch to **ci-cd-pipeline** for deployment infrastructure
- Return to **basic-auth** with proper CI/CD support
- Enhance **ci-cd-pipeline** based on auth requirements

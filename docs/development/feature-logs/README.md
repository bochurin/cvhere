# Feature Implementation Logs

This folder contains detailed implementation plans and progress tracking for individual features across multiple development iterations.

## Organization

**By Feature Area:**
- `basic-app.md` - Basic application foundation (Phase 2)
- `ci-cd-pipeline.md` - CI/CD and infrastructure (Phase 3)
- `basic-auth.md` - Authentication system (cancelled, may restart)
- `profile-builder.md` - Profile building feature (future)
- `matching-engine.md` - Search and matching logic (future)
- `pdf-export.md` - PDF generation feature (future)

## Format

Each feature log should include:
- **Multiple branch iterations** with dates and outcomes
- **Detailed step-by-step plan** with TODO comments
- **Success criteria** for completion
- **Technical decisions** specific to the feature
- **Progress tracking** across all development sessions
- **Branch history** showing evolution over time

## Cross-Feature Development Workflow

**Development progresses gradually across multiple features:**

### Feature Switching Pattern
1. **Start Feature A** - Implement basic foundation
2. **Switch to Feature B** - When Feature A needs dependency
3. **Return to Feature A** - With new capabilities from Feature B
4. **Enhance Feature B** - Based on learnings from Feature A
5. **Continue iterating** - Between features as needs emerge

### Example: Basic App → CI/CD → Auth → Back to CI/CD
- **basic-app**: Phase 1-2 (foundation)
- **ci-cd-pipeline**: Infrastructure setup
- **basic-auth**: Discover need for better deployment
- **ci-cd-pipeline**: Add deployment automation
- **basic-auth**: Resume with proper CI/CD support

**Feature logs track cross-feature evolution:**
- **Branch History**: All branches and when/why switched
- **Dependencies**: What other features were needed
- **Learnings**: How other features influenced this one
- **Status**: Current state and next iteration plan

**Example log structure:**
```markdown
# Feature: Authentication System

## Branch History
- `feature/basic-auth` (2024-12-19) - Cancelled, too complex
- `feature/simple-auth` (future) - Simplified approach

## Current Status
**Latest Branch**: None (planning phase)
**Next Iteration**: Simplified JWT-only approach
```

**Benefits:**
- **Complete history** of feature development
- **Learning from iterations** - what worked/failed
- **Context for future work** - why decisions were made
- **Team knowledge** - anyone can understand feature evolution

# Feature: CI/CD Pipeline

## Branch History
- **`feature/ci-cd-pipeline`** (2024-12-19) - In progress, infrastructure and workflows complete

## Latest Iteration: 2024-12-19 - Automated Build, Test, and Deployment

**Branch**: `feature/ci-cd-pipeline` (in progress)
**Goal**: Implement complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and Terraform infrastructure
**Status**: Infrastructure setup complete, pipeline integration next

## Feature Plan

### ✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Completed)
- ✅ Create Terraform configuration for AWS infrastructure
- ✅ Set up VPC, EC2, Security Groups with environment separation
- ✅ Configure staging and production tfvars files
- ✅ Document infrastructure decisions

### ✅ Phase 2: GitHub Actions Workflows (Completed)
- ✅ Create backend CI/CD workflow (backend.yml)
- ✅ Create frontend CI/CD workflow (frontend.yml)
- ✅ Create Terraform infrastructure workflow (terraform.yml)
- ✅ Configure environment separation (staging/production)
- ✅ Set up pipeline config injection for frontend

### ✅ Phase 3: Pipeline Integration (Completed)
- ✅ Add deployment scripts (deploy-backend.sh, deploy-frontend.sh)
- ✅ Add Terraform backend setup (S3 + DynamoDB)
- ✅ Add health check automation
- ✅ Add Docker support with multi-stage builds
- ✅ Add environment-specific configurations
- ✅ Update package.json with deployment scripts
- ✅ Complete infrastructure with nginx reverse proxy

### ✅ Phase 4: Pipeline Optimization (Completed)
- ✅ Add health checks after deployment
- ✅ Add comprehensive deployment documentation
- ✅ Add environment configuration management
- ✅ Add Docker compose for local development
- ✅ Add monitoring setup documentation

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Terraform infrastructure deploys successfully to AWS
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows trigger on correct paths/branches
- ✅ Pipeline config injection works for different environments
- ✅ Environment separation (staging vs production) working
- ✅ Backend builds and tests pass in pipeline
- ✅ Frontend builds and tests pass in pipeline
- ✅ Infrastructure deploys via Terraform in pipeline
- ✅ Full deployment flow implemented end-to-end
- ✅ Health checks confirm successful deployments
- ✅ Docker support for consistent deployments
- ✅ Comprehensive deployment documentation

## Technical Decisions

- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions (repository integration, cost effective)
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform IaC with AWS (reproducible, version controlled)
- **Environment Strategy**: develop → staging, tags → production
- **Config Injection**: Pipeline replaces config.yaml per environment
- **Path Triggers**: Only run workflows when relevant files change
- **Security**: AWS credentials via GitHub secrets
- **Deployment**: EC2 instances with Docker deployment
- **Monitoring**: Basic health checks and deployment notifications

## Implementation Details

### Backend Pipeline (`backend.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to develop/main, backend file changes
- **Test Job**: Node.js setup, dependency install, build, test
- **Deploy Staging**: Auto-deploy develop branch to staging
- **Deploy Production**: Deploy on version tags (v1.0.0)

### Frontend Pipeline (`frontend.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to develop/main, frontend file changes
- **Test Job**: Node.js setup, build, test (frontend directory)
- **Config Injection**: Pipeline replaces config.yaml per environment
- **Deploy Staging**: staging.cvhere.net with staging backend URL
- **Deploy Production**: cvhere.net with production backend URL

### Infrastructure Pipeline (`terraform.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to main, terraform file changes
- **Plan Job**: Matrix strategy for staging/production planning
- **Apply Staging**: Auto-apply on main branch push
- **Apply Production**: Apply on version tags only

### Environment Strategy
```
develop branch → staging environment
main branch → staging infrastructure
version tags → production deployment
```

### Pipeline Config Injection
```yaml
# Staging
echo "backendUrl: https://api-staging.cvhere.net" > frontend/dist/config.yaml

# Production  
echo "backendUrl: https://api.cvhere.net" > frontend/dist/config.yaml
```

### GitHub Secrets Required
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key for deployment
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key for deployment

## Current Status

**Phase**: All Phases Complete ✅
**Completed**: 
- Complete Terraform infrastructure with S3 backend, VPC, EC2, Security Groups, nginx
- Full GitHub Actions workflows with actual deployment scripts
- Environment separation with staging/production configurations
- Docker support with multi-stage builds and compose files
- Health check automation and monitoring setup
- Comprehensive deployment scripts and documentation
- ✅ **Documentation Workflow Automation**: Complete `scripts/docs-workflow.sh` implementation
- ✅ **Package.json Enhancement**: Added `npm run docs` and terminal clearing for all scripts
- Ready for production deployment
**Next**: Manual testing and AWS setup (credentials, key pairs)

## Cross-Feature Dependencies

**Depends on**: basic-app foundation (health endpoints for deployment verification)
**Enables**: All future features (authentication, profile builder, etc.) will use this CI/CD pipeline
**Learning**: Discovered need for proper infrastructure before complex features like authentication

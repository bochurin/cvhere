# Feature: Basic App Foundation

## Branch History
- **`feature/basic-app`** (2024-12-19) - Completed successfully, merged to develop

## Latest Iteration: 2024-12-19 - Minimal Foundation Implementation

**Branch**: `feature/basic-app` (completed)
**Goal**: Build minimal working application with health checks and foundation for CI/CD
**Outcome**: Successfully completed, solid foundation established

## Feature Plan

### âœ… Phase 1: Minimal Backend (Completed)
- âœ… Create minimal Fastify server with TypeScript
- âœ… Add single health endpoint (/health)
- âœ… Return status, timestamp, environment in health response
- âœ… Test backend health endpoint locally
- âœ… Fix Ctrl+C shutdown issues on Windows

### âœ… Phase 2: Simple Frontend (Completed)
- âœ… Create minimal React app with Vite
- âœ… Add health check component that calls backend
- âœ… Display environment in app title/header with (env: ...) format
- âœ… Show backend connection status (connected/disconnected)
- âœ… Test frontend-backend integration locally
- âœ… Implement pipeline-driven YAML configuration
- âœ… Add CORS support for frontend-backend communication
- âœ… Add 3-second timeout and proper error handling

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Infrastructure & CI/CD (Moved to separate feature)
- ðŸ“‹ Moved to `ci-cd-pipeline` feature for better separation of concerns
- ðŸ“‹ Basic app provides health endpoints for deployment verification

## Success Criteria

- âœ… Backend health endpoint returns proper JSON response
- âœ… Frontend successfully calls backend health endpoint
- âœ… Environment clearly displayed in frontend and browser tab
- âœ… Connection status detection works (Connected/Disconnected)
- âœ… Backend starts/stops reliably with Ctrl+C
- âœ… CORS properly configured for frontend-backend communication
- âœ… Pipeline-driven YAML configuration implemented
- âœ… Clean foundation ready for feature development

## Technical Decisions

- **Backend**: Fastify + TypeScript (minimal, reliable start/stop)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + js-yaml (fast development)
- **Configuration**: Pipeline-driven YAML configs (single build artifact)
- **Connection Detection**: 5-second health checks with 3-second timeout
- **Error Handling**: Proper fetch error handling and fallbacks
- **CORS**: @fastify/cors for frontend-backend communication
- **Environment Display**: Dynamic browser tab titles
- **Deployment**: Simple approach, ready for CI/CD enhancement

## Current Status

**Phase**: All Phases Complete âœ…
**Completed**: 
- Minimal Fastify backend with reliable start/stop (Ctrl+C works)
- React frontend with health check component
- Connection status detection (Connected/Disconnected)
- Environment display in browser tab: "CVHere (env: development)"
- Pipeline-driven YAML configuration system
- CORS support for frontend-backend communication
- 3-second timeout and proper error handling
**Outcome**: Solid foundation ready for CI/CD and authentication features

## Cross-Feature Dependencies

**Enables**: ci-cd-pipeline (provides health endpoints for deployment verification)
**Enables**: All future features (authentication, profile builder, etc.) built on this foundation
**Learning**: Minimal foundation approach worked well, avoided complexity early

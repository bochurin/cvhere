# CVHere - Development Log

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Privacy-first CV platform with atomic data model
**Approach**: Cross-feature development - switch between features as dependencies emerge
**Current Phase**: Phase 3 - CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Project Foundation (Completed)
- ✅ Git Repository with comprehensive structure
- ✅ Documentation organized with decision tracking
- ✅ Architecture decisions (Node.js + React + PostgreSQL + Terraform)
- ✅ Repository structure (monorepo with backend/frontend/shared folders)
- ✅ Development workflow defined (feature branches with CI/CD)

### ✅ Phase 2: Basic App Foundation (Completed)
- ✅ Minimal Fastify backend with TypeScript and health endpoint
- ✅ React frontend with Vite and health check component
- ✅ Pipeline-driven YAML configuration system
- ✅ CORS integration for frontend-backend communication
- ✅ Environment display in browser tab with connection detection
- ✅ Reliable start/stop with proper Ctrl+C handling

### 🚧 Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation (In Progress)
**Branch**: `feature/ci-cd-pipeline`

**Completed:**
- ✅ Terraform infrastructure configuration (AWS VPC, EC2, Security Groups)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows (backend.yml, frontend.yml, terraform.yml)
- ✅ Environment separation with staging/production tfvars
- ✅ Pipeline config injection for environment-specific settings
- ✅ Documentation consolidation and cleanup

**Next Steps:**
- 🕰️ Add build and test scripts to package.json
- 🕰️ Set up AWS credentials in GitHub secrets
- 🕰️ Test Terraform deployment locally
- 🕰️ Test GitHub Actions workflows
- 🕰️ Add actual deployment scripts
- 🕰️ Test full end-to-end deployment flow

### 📋 Phase 4: Authentication System (Planned)
- 📋 Simplified JWT-based authentication (no email verification initially)
- 📋 Basic user registration and login
- 📋 Protected routes and middleware
- 📋 Password hashing with bcrypt

### 📋 Phase 5: Core Features (Planned)
- 📋 Database schema design (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
- 📋 Basic profile builder with atomic data model
- 📋 Simple keyword-based matching algorithm
- 📋 PDF export functionality
- 📋 Contact request system

## Current Status

**Active Branch**: `feature/ci-cd-pipeline`
**Focus**: Complete CI/CD pipeline with Terraform and GitHub Actions
**Ready For**: Adding build/test scripts and pipeline integration

## Development Approach

**Cross-Feature Development**: Features are developed incrementally, switching between them as dependencies and learnings emerge. For example:
- Start **basic-app** foundation
- Switch to **ci-cd-pipeline** for deployment infrastructure
- Return to **basic-auth** with proper CI/CD support
- Enhance **ci-cd-pipeline** based on auth requirements

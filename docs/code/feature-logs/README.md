# Feature Implementation Logs

This folder contains detailed implementation plans and progress tracking for individual features.

## Organization

**By Feature Branch:**
- `basic-auth.md` - Authentication system implementation
- `profile-builder.md` - Profile building feature (future)
- `matching-engine.md` - Search and matching logic (future)
- `pdf-export.md` - PDF generation feature (future)

## Format

Each feature log should include:
- **Branch name** and implementation goal
- **Detailed step-by-step plan** with TODO comments
- **Success criteria** for completion
- **Technical decisions** specific to the feature
- **Progress tracking** during development

## Workflow

1. **Create feature branch** from develop
2. **Create feature log** with detailed plan
3. **Use TODO comments** for Todo Tree integration
4. **Update progress** as implementation proceeds
5. **Clean up TODOs** before merging to develop

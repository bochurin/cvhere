# Feature: CI/CD Pipeline

## Branch History
- **`feature/ci-cd-pipeline`** (2024-12-19) - In progress, infrastructure and workflows complete

## Latest Iteration: 2024-12-19 - Automated Build, Test, and Deployment

**Branch**: `feature/ci-cd-pipeline` (in progress)
**Goal**: Implement complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and Terraform infrastructure
**Status**: Infrastructure setup complete, pipeline integration next

## Feature Plan

### ✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Completed)
- ✅ Create Terraform configuration for AWS infrastructure
- ✅ Set up VPC, EC2, Security Groups with environment separation
- ✅ Configure staging and production tfvars files
- ✅ Document infrastructure decisions

### ✅ Phase 2: GitHub Actions Workflows (Completed)
- ✅ Create backend CI/CD workflow (backend.yml)
- ✅ Create frontend CI/CD workflow (frontend.yml)
- ✅ Create Terraform infrastructure workflow (terraform.yml)
- ✅ Configure environment separation (staging/production)
- ✅ Set up pipeline config injection for frontend

### 🚧 Phase 3: Pipeline Integration (In Progress)
- 🕰️ Add build and test scripts to package.json
- 🕰️ Set up AWS credentials in GitHub secrets
- 🕰️ Test Terraform deployment locally
- 🕰️ Test GitHub Actions workflows with dummy commits
- 🕰️ Add actual deployment scripts for EC2
- 🕰️ Test full deployment flow end-to-end

### 📋 Phase 4: Pipeline Optimization (Planned)
- 📋 Add health checks after deployment
- 📋 Add rollback automation on failure
- 📋 Add deployment notifications (Slack/email)
- 📋 Test staging and production deployments
- 📋 Add monitoring and alerting

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Terraform infrastructure deploys successfully to AWS
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows trigger on correct paths/branches
- ✅ Pipeline config injection works for different environments
- ✅ Environment separation (staging vs production) working
- 🕰️ Backend builds and tests pass in pipeline
- 🕰️ Frontend builds and tests pass in pipeline
- 🕰️ Infrastructure deploys via Terraform in pipeline
- 🕰️ Full deployment flow works end-to-end
- 🕰️ Health checks confirm successful deployments

## Technical Decisions

- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions (repository integration, cost effective)
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform IaC with AWS (reproducible, version controlled)
- **Environment Strategy**: develop → staging, tags → production
- **Config Injection**: Pipeline replaces config.yaml per environment
- **Path Triggers**: Only run workflows when relevant files change
- **Security**: AWS credentials via GitHub secrets
- **Deployment**: EC2 instances with Docker deployment
- **Monitoring**: Basic health checks and deployment notifications

## Implementation Details

### Backend Pipeline (`backend.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to develop/main, backend file changes
- **Test Job**: Node.js setup, dependency install, build, test
- **Deploy Staging**: Auto-deploy develop branch to staging
- **Deploy Production**: Deploy on version tags (v1.0.0)

### Frontend Pipeline (`frontend.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to develop/main, frontend file changes
- **Test Job**: Node.js setup, build, test (frontend directory)
- **Config Injection**: Pipeline replaces config.yaml per environment
- **Deploy Staging**: staging.cvhere.net with staging backend URL
- **Deploy Production**: cvhere.net with production backend URL

### Infrastructure Pipeline (`terraform.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to main, terraform file changes
- **Plan Job**: Matrix strategy for staging/production planning
- **Apply Staging**: Auto-apply on main branch push
- **Apply Production**: Apply on version tags only

### Environment Strategy
```
develop branch → staging environment
main branch → staging infrastructure
version tags → production deployment
```

### Pipeline Config Injection
```yaml
# Staging
echo "backendUrl: https://api-staging.cvhere.net" > frontend/dist/config.yaml

# Production  
echo "backendUrl: https://api.cvhere.net" > frontend/dist/config.yaml
```

### GitHub Secrets Required
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key for deployment
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key for deployment

## Current Status

**Phase**: Phase 2 Complete ✅, Phase 3 In Progress 🚧
**Completed**: 
- Terraform infrastructure configuration with VPC, EC2, Security Groups
- GitHub Actions workflows for backend, frontend, and infrastructure
- Environment separation with staging/production tfvars
- Pipeline config injection for environment-specific settings
- Documentation updated with CI/CD decisions
**Next**: Phase 3 - Add build scripts and test pipeline integration

## Cross-Feature Dependencies

**Depends on**: basic-app foundation (health endpoints for deployment verification)
**Enables**: All future features (authentication, profile builder, etc.) will use this CI/CD pipeline
**Learning**: Discovered need for proper infrastructure before complex features like authentication

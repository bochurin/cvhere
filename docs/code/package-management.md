# Package Management Decision

## 2024-12-19 - Package Manager and Structure

**Context**: Choose package manager and structure for CVHere monorepo
**Options**: 
- Individual package.json per component vs single root package.json
- npm vs yarn vs pnpm

**Decisions**:
1. **Single root package.json**: Simpler for bootstrap MVP
2. **npm**: Standard package manager, no extra setup needed
3. **Vite**: Modern bundler for faster development and builds

**Reasons**:
- **Simplicity**: One package.json to manage
- **Bootstrap friendly**: Minimal complexity for solo start
- **Standard tooling**: npm works everywhere, CI/CD ready
- **Easy migration**: Can split to workspaces later if needed

**Implementation**:
- Root package.json with all dependencies
- Scripts for backend, frontend, and full-stack development
- Concurrently for running multiple services
- Vite for frontend bundling (faster than Create React App)
- Standard npm commands for development workflow

**Future considerations**:
- Can migrate to npm workspaces when team grows
- Can switch to yarn/pnpm if performance becomes issue

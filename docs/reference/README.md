# Reference Materials

Supporting documentation and archived materials for development reference.

## Folders

- **[tools/](tools/)** - Development tools and IDE configuration guides
- **[knowledge/](knowledge/)** - General knowledge and learning materials
- **[chat-backup/](chat-backup/)** - Archived development chat sessions

## Purpose

This folder contains reference materials that support development but aren't part of the core project documentation:

### Development Tools
- Tool documentation and setup guides
- IDE configuration examples and best practices
- Development environment setup instructions

### Knowledge Base
- Learning materials and external references
- Research notes and best practices
- General knowledge supporting development

### Historical Archive
- Chat session backups from development discussions
- Historical context for decision-making processes
- Learning materials and external references

These materials provide context and support for developers but don't define the project strategy or current development status.

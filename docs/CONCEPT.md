# CVHere - Concept Overview

## Core Vision
Privacy-first profile building and matching platform with atomic, linked data architecture. Extensible beyond career matching to dating, networking, and other relationship-based connections.

## Target Users
- **Profile Builders**: Create flexible, targeted profiles from atomic data
- **Searchers**: Find and match people through query-based system
- **Use Cases**: Job seeking, dating, professional networking, collaboration matching

## Key Features

### For Profile Builders
- **Atomic Data Model**: Flexible entities (skills, interests, values, experiences, goals) as linked data
- **Rich Relationships**: Many-to-many connections with properties (strength, context, duration)
- **Flexible Hierarchy**: Start from any entity (interest → activity → goal or vice versa)
- **Dynamic Profile Generation**: Filter and structure data for specific contexts/audiences
- **Custom Templates**: Save structure + filters as reusable templates
- **Auto-suggestions**: Smart entity and relationship recommendations
- **Export Options**: Generate profiles/documents from filtered data with chosen templates

### For Searchers
- **Query-based Search**: Requirements as weighted queries against anonymous profiles
- **Relevance Scoring**: Match people by criteria with configurable weights
- **Request System**: Send interest requests to anonymous profiles
- **Response Management**: Filter auto-responses from manual responses
- **Context-Aware**: Same platform, different matching contexts (career, dating, networking)

## Privacy-First Architecture
- **No Personal Data on Server**: All personal info in localStorage only
- **Anonymous Matching**: Server stores only anonymized skill vectors
- **Ephemeral Communication**: Temporary encrypted messaging, auto-delete
- **User-Controlled Sharing**: Candidates decide when/what to share
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Without server storage (P2P or encrypted cloud)

## Technical Approach
- **Graph-based Data**: Rich entity relationships with properties
- **Client-Side Storage**: localStorage/IndexedDB for personal data
- **Anonymous Profiles**: Aggregated patterns for matching without identity
- **Temporary File Sharing**: Encrypted, expiring PDF/CV sharing
- **Auto-Response Logic**: Configurable criteria-based responses

## Architecture Components
- **Frontend**: Complex state management for graph data
- **Backend**: Anonymous matching engine, temporary messaging
- **Database**: Graph DB for relationships, minimal personal data
- **Infrastructure**: AWS deployment via Terraform

## Platform Extensibility
- **Career Matching**: Skills, experience, job requirements
- **Dating**: Interests, values, lifestyle, compatibility factors
- **Networking**: Professional goals, collaboration interests, expertise
- **General Matching**: Configurable entity types and relationship models

## Development Status
Concept phase - ready for technical implementation planning.
